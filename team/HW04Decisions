"For documenting at least one team meeting where you as a team discuss HW04 and help each other get organized on what exactly each team member contributes in the topic area they were assigned.  Also, for documenting both the planned contribution for each team member and listing the team member who will assess/comment on that student's HW04 in terms of team product impact in team/HW04Decisions.md. Everyone should review exactly one HW04 contribution and you should assign the students with some of the biggest expertise in the area of the topic as assessment partners."
