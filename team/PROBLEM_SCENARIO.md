**Characters:**

Jason is a 4th year computer science college student struggling in some of his upper div classes without any friends in the same major as himself that can help him out.
He is unaware of any discord or other group chats for peer studying and isn't able to attend many professor and ta office hours

Shelby is a graduating high school student in computer science who only has limited experience with AP Computer Science but wants to expand her knowledge so she is prepared for her first few cs classes. 
She is moving to a college away from home so she doesn't know many people in her new college and is looking to meeting people within her major.

Ryan is a self taught programmer who isn't sure if his knowledge is up-to-par with what jobs are expecting of him and what college level education is teaching.
He wants to reach out with students in his field in order to make sure his self teaching is on the right course.

**Scenario:**

They all download and login to the app, Jason with his school email and Shelby and Ryan with another non college school email. (Differences in account emails TBD).
Jason decides to make a study session on the app with lax requirements on who is allowed to join where Shelby and Ryan decide to join after seeing it on the home page of available study sessions reflective of their personal preferences.
They end up meeting in person (somehow) at the agreed location and time of the initial study session and afterwards they are able to connect with one another is case if they, or anyone else they know want to have other study sessions on similar topics.
