# User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a friend and see what groups they are part of because I want to be able to interact with people that have similar interests as me
- As a user I want to be able to have additional options when searching for groups (location, etc) because I want an easier time navigating towards the study groups for me
- As a user I want to be able to see more information about the group before joining it because I want to make informed decisions on waht study groups I'm joining
- As a user I want to be able to have confidence that the study group will actually happen and is safe through some user rating or credibility function because I want to have higih quality study groups
- As a user I want to have the app remember me between login sessions because it's annoying having to alawys sign in
