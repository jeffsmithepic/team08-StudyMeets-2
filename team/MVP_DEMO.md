==========================================================

Installation
Prerequisites
TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before following your installation instructions (e.g. which version(s) of what framework(s), if any). The challenge is to eventually deploy a mobile app from your GitHub repo on the press of a button. For the near term, you can decide to make an off-line generated package (apk for Android or ipa for IOS) available as the latest binary distribution, but at some point during this class, there will be a requirement to generate this package from your current code base automatically.

Dependencies
TODO: List which libraries / add-ons you added to the project, and the purpose each of those add-ons serves in your app.

Installation Steps
TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you give complete instructions to get your project going from scratch). Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. Note that with the use of GitHub Actions, these instructions can eventually be fully automated (e.g. with actLinks to an external site., you can run GitHub Actions locally).

Functionality
TODO: Write usage instructions. Structuring it as a walkthrough can help structure this section, and showcase your features.

Known Problems
TODO: Describe any known issues, bugs, odd behaviors or code smells. Provide steps to reproduce the problem and/or name a file or a function where the problem lives.

Contributing
TODO: Leave the steps below if you want others outside your team to contribute to your project.
