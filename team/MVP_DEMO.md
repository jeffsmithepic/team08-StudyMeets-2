# Installation
# Prerequisites
TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before following your installation instructions (e.g. which version(s) of what framework(s), if any). The challenge is to eventually deploy a mobile app from your GitHub repo on the press of a button. For the near term, you can decide to make an off-line generated package (apk for Android or ipa for IOS) available as the latest binary distribution, but at some point during this class, there will be a requirement to generate this package from your current code base automatically.

# Installation Steps
TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you give complete instructions to get your project going from scratch). Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. Note that with the use of GitHub Actions, these instructions can eventually be fully automated (e.g. with actLinks to an external site., you can run GitHub Actions locally).
