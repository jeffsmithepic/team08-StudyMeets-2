We plan to use React Native. Kai has experience in it, but the rest of us do not yet. 
We are all familiar with Agile development. 
We will make sure to follow the correct practices during our Daily scrums, retros, sprint planning meetings, etc.

Since we are going to be working on different parts of the mobile app, we will watch tutorials and read documentation to solve any issues that may arise.
