We plan to use React Native. Kai has experience in it, but the rest of us do not yet. 
We are all familiar with Agile development. 
We will make sure to follow the correct practices during our Daily scrums, retros, sprint planning meetings, etc.

Since we are going to be working on different parts of the mobile app, we will watch tutorials and read documentation to solve any issues that may arise. 

* Luis: Swift experience. I hope to learn more about implementing AI and using it as a resource for app development.
* Garvin: Basic agile and react experience from cs156 and cs148. Mainly worked on frontend for those courses so I would like to focus on backends esp in regards to allowing users to communicate with one another.
* Tim: 
* Meron: Some experience using Java and React mainly from cs156. Looking forward to learning React Native and practicing more Java.
* Wesley: I have experience in Java, React but no experience in React Native. I am hoping I am able to learn more about skills such as API development and React Native.
* David: I have touched react a little bit (in cmpsc 156) but not too much. I would also like to learn about using APIs. 
* Kai: I have experience with Java and React, and a little experience with React Native. I hope to further master them and complete a complete mobile project using these technologies.
