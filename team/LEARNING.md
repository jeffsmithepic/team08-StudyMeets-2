We plan to use React Native. Kai has experience in it, but the rest of us do not yet. 
We are all familiar with Agile development. 
We will make sure to follow the correct practices during our Daily scrums, retros, sprint planning meetings, etc.

Since we are going to be working on different parts of the mobile app, we will watch tutorials and read documentation to solve any issues that may arise. 

* Luis: Swift experience. I hope to learn more about implementing AI and using it as a resource for app development.
* Garvin: Basic agile and react experience from cs156 and cs148. Mainly worked on frontend for those courses so I would like to focus on backends esp in regards to allowing users to communicate with one another.
* Tim: 
* Meron: 
* Wesley: I have experience in Java, React but no experience in React Native. I am hoping I am able to learn more about skills such as API development and React Native.
* David:
