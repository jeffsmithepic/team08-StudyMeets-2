## Retro Assessment and Result of Experiment

Result: There have been more messages in both the group chat and slack including: asking for help, sending resources, updating group on progress, and asking for peer reviews on code

* We used a group discussion similar to the daily standups where everyone had a chance to speak. Once everyone had spoken I asked if there was anything else anyone wanted to add, when everyone was done with their thoughts we moved on.
* The retro went well, since we are at the beginning of the project it felt like there wasn't much we wanted to change.
* For the next retrospective I would recommend giving people more time to think before jumping into discussion, I was speaking first a lot and maybe not giving everyone enough time to formulate their thoughts.
