Date of Retrospective: 10/18/24

* Led by: Meron
* Present: Meron, David, Luis, Wesley
* Absent: Kai, Tim, Garvin

## Action item

* a goal: Communicate more, helping each other with the project/HW and letting everyone know where you are. Also sharing useful resources with the group.
* a change: We plan to utilize slack more and the messaging group chat, updating each other on our progress/issues and sending resources or tips to help others.
* a measurement: We can check if our experiment worked if there have been more messages in the group chat and slack by our next retro.

* There have been more messages in both the group chat and slack including: asking for help, sending resources, updating group on progress, and asking for peer reviews on code.

## Optional

* We want to aim for at least two peer reviews on any Pull Request we have before we merge any code to main.
* Remember to do the CATME survey and update our experiment's result in this file.

## Retro Assessment

* We used a group discussion similar to the daily standups where everyone had a chance to speak. Once everyone had spoken I asked if there was anything else anyone wanted to add, when everyone was done with their thoughts we moved on.
* The retro went well, since we are at the beginning of the project it felt like there wasn't much we wanted to change.
* For the next retrospective I would recommend giving people more time to think before jumping into discussion, I was speaking first a lot and maybe not giving everyone enough time to formulate their thoughts.
