## Action item

* a goal: Communicate more, helping each other with the project/HW and letting everyone know where you are. Also sharing useful resources with the group.
* a change: We plan to utilize slack more and the messaging group chat, updating each other on our progress/issues and sending resources or tips to help others.
* a measurement: We can check if our experiment worked if there have been more messages in the group chat and slack by our next retro.

## Optional

* We want to aim for at least two peer reviews on any Pull Request we have before we merge any code to main.
* Remember to do the CATME survey and update our experiment's result in this file.
