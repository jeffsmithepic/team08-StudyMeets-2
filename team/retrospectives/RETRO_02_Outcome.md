## Retro Assessment and Result of Experiment

Result: Getting pull requests accepted is still somewhat slow, usually requires someone to ask in person during a class or discussion for a pr to get approved. Weren't too many new prs made out of class so it's hard to see how long those will last given it's a new sprint.

* We used a group discussion similar to the daily standups where everyone had a chance to speak. Once everyone had spoken I asked if there was anything else anyone wanted to add, when everyone was done with their thoughts we moved on.
* Not much talking during the retro, but we all seemed to be on the smae page
* For the next retrospective I would recommend not giving too open ended of questions since that doesn't necessarily encourage someone to speak. Possibly make more directed questions while be conscious to maintain neutrality and not trying to steer the conversation
