Taking attendance for today’s lab, and making sure your name is on your log with absence/presence logged is a portion of your group’s grade for this week’s lab.

NOTE 1: The first team member listed should be the ‘lead’ for this meeting, i.e. a team member who is responsible for recording meeting information this time (also called a ‘scribe’). In the future, this person likely called/coordinated the meeting. Meeting leads are different from project owner and Scrum master and we expect/require that this responsibility rotates among your team members!

NOTE 2: Having a group member (or two) absent will not cause your group’s grade to be reduced. However you are require to record attendance in order for the group to get full credit for the Section. In the future, team members that cannot make it to a meeting should message their information to the meeting lead beforehand.

NOTE 3 In the future, meeting time can also be something like lect05 (for Lecture 5), or 10-17-2pm for an out-of-class-time meeting.
