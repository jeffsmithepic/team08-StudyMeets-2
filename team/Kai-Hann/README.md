User Manual
Before Contribution:
Users lack clear guidance on how to use the function.
It is not possible to clearly distinguish the permissions and operation procedures of "creators" and "joiners".

After Contribution:
The basic structure of the user manual is built, and detailed contents such as installation, quick start, function operation, account management, etc. will be covered later.
The role definitions of "creator" and "joiner" and their corresponding function descriptions are clarified.

Design Document
Before Contribution:
The project only has a simple text description, no architecture diagram and User Flow
The reason for selecting the technology stack is unclear
The function priority and verification method are not recorded in detail

After Contribution:
The system architecture diagram is improved, and the implementation methods of the front-end (React Native), back-end (Firebase) and real-time update mechanism are described in detail.
The reason for selecting the technology stack is recorded.
The function priority is sorted out
