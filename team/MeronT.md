My name is Meron Tesfandrias and I am a fourth year computer science student. My favorite coding language is C++, but I also know some python and java, 
I have some experience with React from CS156 and am looking forward to learning about ReactNative. In my free time I like to read, my favorite authors right now are
Brandon Sanderson and Phillip K. Dick. I also like to watch the NBA with my favorite team being the Lakers.
