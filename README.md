# team08-StudyMeets

Tech Stack: React Native

An app tailored for UCSB students that displays study sessions and events based on location and interests, with student ID verification for full access; hosts can create both study and social sessions, set participant limits, and restrict access by distance to keep it local; additional features include friend recommendations, college-specific events, and options for verifying students through email domains, LinkedIn profiles, or existing campus networks.
